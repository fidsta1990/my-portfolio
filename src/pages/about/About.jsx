            <p>
              Iâ€™m passionate about all things Front End Web Development. I am an
              extremely well driven individual with a willing approach to devote
              to tasks set. Ambitions of mine are to progress as a junior web
              developer in JavaScript and to evolve into a full stack role.
            </p>
            <p>

              free to get in touch as I would love to collaborate with you.
